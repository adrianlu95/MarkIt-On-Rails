## 4.1 Plan Introduction

MarkIt is an application that aims to bridge the gap between buyers and sellers within a college community by providing them with a means of direct communication. Within the application, users will be able to search, sell, purchase, post, and track goods. The distinction between MarkIt and other similar existing applications is its exclusive availability to verified college students when they signup using a valid .edu email address. MarkIt will be accessible through web browsers on computers as well as mobile devices. In developing the application, the tasks required compose of becoming familiar with the database for storing and retrieving data about users and items, learning the development environment (Ruby, Ruby on Rails, SQLite3, Sass), and creating the user interface that is not exceedingly painful to use.

Within the scope of using SQL, the following tasks should be completed by the designated deadlines:
- Login/Sign-up (02/28)
- User Profiles (03/14)
- Creating a New Post (03/21)
- Retrieving Data (03/28)

Creating the user interface should be accomplished by the following deadlines:
- Searching Items (03/20)
- Tagging Items (03/27)

Testing the product should be accomplished by the following date:
- Beta Testing (04/12)
- MVP User Interface (04/12)
